Welcome to the official documentation website for the Accessible Astro Projects! This comprehensive resource is built with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build), Astro's powerful documentation framework, to provide clear and accessible documentation for our suite of accessibility-focused tools. Whether you're a developer looking to build more inclusive web applications or someone interested in learning about web accessibility, this documentation covers:

- [Accessible Astro Starter](https://github.com/incluud/accessible-astro-starter): Fully accessible starter for kickstarting Astro projects, with Tailwind.
- [Accessible Astro Components](https://github.com/incluud/accessible-astro-components/): Library of reusable, accessible components build for Astro.
- [Accessible Astro Dashboard](https://github.com/incluud/accessible-astro-dashboard/): User-friendly dashboard interface with a login screen and widgets.

## The story behind Accessible Astro

Accessible Astro started as a personal project by [Mark Teekman](https://github.com/markteekman) in 2021 when Astro was in its early stages, born from a passion for web accessibility and the Astro framework. What began as a single starter template grew into a family of accessible solutions, leading to the creation of [Incluud](https://github.com/incluud), an initiative with [Peter Padberg](https://github.com/peterpadberg) to make the web more inclusive. Today, these projects continue to grow and evolve with the help of our amazing community, staying true to their original purpose: making web accessibility easier for developers and better for everyone.
