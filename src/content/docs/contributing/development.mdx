## Development setup

Before you start contributing, make sure you have the right tools and environment set up. This guide will help you get up and running with the project quickly.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.14.1 or higher
- npm, pnpm, or Yarn
- Git

### Local development

Getting the development environment running is straightforward. Follow these steps to start contributing:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Hot reload">
  The development server supports hot reloading - your changes will appear instantly!
</Aside>

## Project structure

Understanding the project structure helps you navigate the codebase more effectively. Here's an overview of our main directories:

```bash
accessible-astro-components/
├── src/
│   ├── components/     # Component source files
│   ├── styles/        # Global styles and variables
│   └── utils/         # Utility functions
├── tests/             # Test files
└── package.json       # Project configuration
```

## Coding standards

We maintain high coding standards to ensure our components are accessible, performant, and maintainable. Here are our key guidelines:

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Include proper type definitions
- Avoid `any` types where possible

### Components
- Follow the [WAI-ARIA guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Support keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers

### CSS
- Use logical properties
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Support dark mode
- Respect user preferences

<Aside type="note" title="CSS custom properties">
  Define component-specific variables using the `--component-` prefix.
</Aside>

## Testing

Quality assurance is crucial for our components. We use different types of tests to ensure everything works as expected:

### Unit tests
```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### Integration tests
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### Accessibility tests
```bash
npm run test:a11y
```

## Building

When you're ready to create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Production build">
  Always test your changes with a production build before submitting a PR.
</Aside>

## Common tasks

Here are some frequent development tasks and how to handle them:

### Adding a new component

1. Create component file:
```bash
src/components/NewComponent.tsx
```

2. Add tests:
```bash
tests/NewComponent.test.ts
```

3. Update documentation:
```bash
docs/components/new-component.mdx
```

### Updating dependencies

Regular dependency updates help keep the project secure and up-to-date:

1. Check for updates:
```bash
npm outdated
```

2. Update packages:
```bash
npm update
```

3. Test thoroughly after updates

## Troubleshooting

When you run into issues, here are some common solutions:

### Common issues

1. **Build errors**
   - Clear the cache: `npm run clean`
   - Remove node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules`
   - Fresh install: `npm install`

2. **Test failures**
   - Check test coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
   - Run specific tests: `npm run test NewComponent.test.ts`

<Aside type="caution" title="Breaking changes">
  If you're making breaking changes, ensure they're well documented and follow semantic versioning.
</Aside>

## Performance

Performance is a key aspect of accessibility. Keep these principles in mind:

- Use lazy loading where appropriate
- Optimize images and assets
- Keep bundle size minimal
- Monitor performance metrics
