## Development workflow

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and start contributing. Whether you're working on components, themes, or documentation, this workflow will help you stay organized and efficient.

<Steps>
1. **Setup your repository**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
   cd REPO-NAME

   # Install dependencies
   npm install

   # Start development server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the style guide
   - Write meaningful commit messages
   - Add tests where applicable
   - Update documentation

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Components
   npm run typecheck   # Check TypeScript
   npm run build      # Test production build

   # Themes
   npm run build      # Test production build
   npm run preview    # Test built site
   ```

4. **Submit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "type: description"
   git push origin branch-name
   ```
</Steps>

## Coding standards

We maintain high standards for our code to ensure accessibility, maintainability, and consistency across all projects. These guidelines help us create robust and user-friendly components and themes.

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Include proper type definitions
- Document props with JSDoc comments
- Avoid `any` types

### Accessibility
- Follow [WAI-ARIA guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Support keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers
- Consider color contrast
- Support reduced motion

### CSS
- Use logical properties (inline/block)
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Support dark mode with light-dark()
- Use consistent border-radius (0.5rem)
- Use HSL colors
- Support prefers-reduced-motion
- Use :where() for lower specificity

<Aside type="tip" title="CSS custom properties">
  Use semantic names for variables:
  ```css
  --component-spacing: 1rem;
  --component-radius: 0.5rem;
  --component-transition: 0.2s ease;
  ```
</Aside>

## Testing

Quality assurance is a crucial part of our development process. We focus on manual testing and accessibility validation to ensure our components and themes work well for everyone.

### Components
- Manual accessibility testing
- TypeScript validation
- Browser testing
- Screen reader testing
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Reduced motion testing

### Themes
- Cross-browser testing
- Responsive testing
- Performance testing
- Accessibility validation
- Dark mode testing
- Screen reader testing
- Keyboard navigation testing

## Common issues

During development, you might encounter some common issues. Here are some solutions that can help you resolve them quickly and get back to coding.

### Build errors
```bash
# Clear cache and node_modules
npm run clean
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Type errors
- Check prop types
- Update type definitions
- Run typecheck command

<Aside type="caution" title="Breaking changes">
  Major changes require:
  - Documentation updates
  - Migration guides
  - Version bump
  - Changelog entry
