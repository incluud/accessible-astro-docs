title: Reduced motion
description: A fully accessible reduced motion toggle that respects system preferences and disables animations for users who need them.

import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { ReducedMotion } from 'accessible-astro-components';
import { Icon } from 'astro-icon/components';

## Introduction

The Reduced motion component provides a toggle for enabling or disabling animations and transitions across your website. It respects the user's system `prefers-reduced-motion` preference by default, persists user choices, and exposes a global JavaScript API for programmatic control. This is essential for users with vestibular disorders, motion sensitivity, or those who simply prefer a calmer browsing experience.

## When to use

- Accessibility settings panels
- User preference controls
- Sites with significant animations
- WCAG compliance (Success Criterion 2.3.3)
- Command palette / launcher integration
- Supporting users with vestibular disorders

## Quick example

<div class="not-content">
  <p>Click the toggle below to switch between normal and reduced motion mode:</p>
  <div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; align-items: center; margin-top: 1rem;">
    <ReducedMotion />
    <span>Try using keyboard navigation (Tab + Enter/Space) to toggle!</span>
  </div>
</div>

<Aside type="caution" title="Example component">
  The toggle here demonstrates the component but may not visually affect this documentation site since Starlight uses its own styling system.

## Usage

Learn how to implement the ReducedMotion component in your project.

```astro
---
import { ReducedMotion } from 'accessible-astro-components'
---

<!-- Default - respects system preference -->
<ReducedMotion />

<!-- With custom icons -->
<ReducedMotion>
  <Icon name="ion:play-outline" slot="off" />
  <Icon name="ion:pause-outline" slot="on" />
</ReducedMotion>

<!-- Force reduced motion on by default -->
<ReducedMotion initialMode="on" />

<!-- Force animations on by default (ignores system preference) -->
<ReducedMotion initialMode="off" />
```

<Aside type="tip" title="System preference">
  By default (`initialMode="auto"`), the component respects the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` system preference. Once the user interacts with the toggle, their choice is saved and takes precedence.
</Aside>

<Aside title="Class .reduce-motion">
  The component sets a class of `reduce-motion` on the `html` element when reduced motion mode is active. You can use this class to conditionally disable animations.
</Aside>

## Props

Configure the ReducedMotion component using these available props to customize its behavior and appearance.

<div class="props-wrapper">
| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `initialMode` | `'on' \| 'off' \| 'auto'` | `'auto'` | Sets the initial mode. 'auto' respects system preference |
| `label` | `string` | `'Toggle Reduced Motion'` | Accessible label for the toggle button |
| `class` | `string` | `''` | Additional CSS classes to apply |
</div>

## Slots

The ReducedMotion component supports named slots for customizing the icons displayed in normal and reduced motion modes.

<div class="props-wrapper">
| Slot | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `off` | Icon or content to display when animations are enabled |
| `on` | Icon or content to display when reduced motion is active |
</div>

## JavaScript API

The ReducedMotion component exposes a global `window.reducedMotion` API for programmatic control. This is useful for integrating with command palettes, launchers, or other UI elements.

```javascript
// Toggle reduced motion mode
window.reducedMotion.toggle()

// Enable reduced motion (disable animations)
window.reducedMotion.enable()

// Disable reduced motion (enable animations)
window.reducedMotion.disable()

// Check if reduced motion is enabled
window.reducedMotion.isEnabled() // returns boolean
```

### Events

The component dispatches a `reducemotion:change` custom event when the mode changes:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('reducemotion:change', (e) => {
  console.log('Reduced motion enabled:', e.detail.enabled)
})
```

### Launcher integration

The component automatically listens for `launcher:action` events with `action: 'toggle-reduced-motion'`, making it compatible with the [Accessible Astro Launcher](https://github.com/incluud/accessible-astro-launcher) out of the box.

## Accessibility

Accessibility isn't an afterthought - it's built into the core of this component. The ReducedMotion component is built with accessibility in mind:

- Uses semantic button element
- Proper ARIA attributes (`aria-pressed`, `aria-label`)
- Maintains focus states
- Persists across page loads using `localStorage`
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` system preference by default
- Disables all animations and transitions when active

### Why reduced motion matters

Some users experience discomfort, dizziness, or nausea when viewing animations. This includes:

- Users with vestibular disorders
- Users with motion sensitivity
- Users with certain cognitive disabilities
- Users who simply prefer less motion

By providing this toggle, you give users control over their browsing experience.

## Styling

Make the ReducedMotion component your own with custom styling while maintaining its accessibility features.

<Aside type="caution" title="Accessibility considerations">
  When applying custom styles, ensure they don't compromise accessibility by maintaining sufficient color contrast and touch target sizes.
</Aside>

### Default reduced motion styles

The component includes global styles that disable animations when reduced motion mode is active:

```css
/* These styles are automatically applied */
.reduce-motion *,
.reduce-motion *::before,
.reduce-motion *::after {
  animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
  transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  scroll-behavior: auto !important;
}
```

### Custom animation handling

You can also check for reduced motion in your own animations:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="CSS">
    ```css
    .animated-element {
      animation: slide-in 0.3s ease-out;
    }

    /* Disable animation when reduced motion is active */
    .reduce-motion .animated-element {
      animation: none;
    }

    /* Or use the media query for CSS-only solutions */
    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
      .animated-element {
        animation: none;
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    // Check programmatically before starting animations
    if (!window.reducedMotion?.isEnabled()) {
      element.animate([
        { opacity: 0 },
        { opacity: 1 }
      ], {
        duration: 300,
        easing: 'ease-out'
      })
    }

    // Or listen for changes
    document.addEventListener('reducemotion:change', (e) => {
      if (e.detail.enabled) {
        // Stop or skip animations
        cancelAnimationFrame(animationId)
      }
    })
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
