## Using components

Our components package provides ready-to-use, accessible components that you can easily add to any Astro project. Here's how to get started:

<Steps>

1. Install the package

    ```bash
    npm install accessible-astro-components
    ```

2. Import components

    ```astro
    ---
    import { Modal, Notification } from 'accessible-astro-components'
    ---
    ```

3. Use in your template

    ```astro
    <button id="modal-trigger">Open Modal</button>

    <Modal
      triggerId="modal-trigger"
      title="Welcome!"
    >
      <p>You've successfully added your first accessible component!</p>
    </Modal>
    ```

</Steps>
