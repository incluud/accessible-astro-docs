  This checklist covers the basics of accessibility testing. While it's not exhaustive, it helps catch common issues before conducting a formal audit. Remember that regular testing throughout development is key to maintaining accessible websites and applications.

When developing websites or applications, it's crucial to regularly check for accessibility during the design and development process. This guide provides a comprehensive checklist to help you test your work. A good practice is to test using only your keyboard, zooming to 400% at 1280×1024 pixels resolution, and using a screen reader (like VoiceOver).

## General Checks

The foundation of accessibility starts with proper content structure, color contrast, and semantic HTML:

- Is the language properly set (`<html lang="en">`)?
- Are skip links present to the main content?
- Is all content wrapped in proper landmarks (`header`, `main`, `footer`, `nav`, `article`, `section`, `aside`)?
- Does the color contrast meet requirements (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)?
- Do navigation elements have appropriate `aria-label` attributes?
- Do interactive elements and links have clear focus indicators?
- Are links opening in new tabs properly indicated (visually and in text)?
- Is there a logical tab order?
- Is all content accessible at 400% zoom on 1280×1024 resolution?
- Is horizontal scrolling prevented at 400% zoom?
- Is the heading structure semantic (`h1` > `h2` > `h3` etc.)?
- Are appropriate HTML elements used for their intended purpose?
- Are JavaScript-driven changes properly announced to screen readers?
- Are page titles informative and properly set?
- Is the logo properly labeled and linked?
- Is an accessibility statement present?

## Media Content

For images, videos, and animations:

- Do videos have captions and audio descriptions (or transcripts)?
- Do videos have clear titles (e.g., on `iframe` elements)?
- Are keyboard shortcuts disabled for embedded videos where necessary?
- Do decorative images have empty `alt` attributes while informative images have descriptive alternatives?
- Can animations longer than 5 seconds be paused?

## Keyboard Navigation

Test your site without a mouse or trackpad:

- Can the menu be operated with arrow keys?
- Can submenus be opened with enter/space/down arrow?
- Can submenus be closed with escape?
- Is there a focus trap on open submenus?
- Do submenus have proper ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`)?

## Screen Reader Compatibility

Test with a screen reader and ensure the content makes sense:

- Is the correct information being read?
- Are "Read more" links contextual (e.g., "Read more about accessibility testing")?
- Do interactive controls announce their state correctly?

## Forms

Essential form checks:

- Does each label have a `for` attribute matching its input's `id`?
- Are error messages announced in an `aria-live` region?
- Are there skip links to error messages that focus on the relevant input?
- Are error messages clear and instructive?
- Are appropriate `autocomplete` attributes used?

## Interactive Controls

For modals, accordions, and other interactive elements:

- Do `dialog` elements work with keyboard and close with escape?
- Can `dialog` elements be closed by clicking the backdrop?
- Are `details`/`summary` elements properly marked up?
- Are sliders/carousels keyboard-accessible and properly announced?
- Are interactive elements using appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-pressed`, `aria-label`)?
